Each call on the stack stores a separate copy of the variables defined in the function. The array is passed by reference so a separate copy of the array is not created for each function call. As we can have O(log(n)) calls to the function, the space complexity of the recursive version should include the O(log(n)) auxiliary space. Hence, the overall space complexity is:\n","\n","Input space: O(n)\n","Auxiliary space: O(log n)\n","\n","Total Space: O(n + log n) OR O(n)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{"id":"8jytLsiVmPr7"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["'50 found'"]},"execution_count":12,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["def recursive_bs(alist, target):\n","    left_point, right_point = 0, len(alist) - 1\n","    middle = (left_point + right_point) //2\n","    if target > alist[middle]:\n","       return recursive_bs(alist[middle:right_point + 1], target)\n","    elif target <alist[middle]:\n","        return recursive_bs(alist[left_point:middle + 1], target)\n","    else: \n","        return f'{target} found'\n","    \n","\n","recursive_bs([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,40,50,100,101,120], 50)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"TpYt8blzmPr7"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.7"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
